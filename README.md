This was a package that I developed to help in the analysis of 3'-seq data for our 2013 [Ubiquitously transcribed genes use alternative polyadenylation to achieve tissue-specific expression](http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/early/2013/10/20/gad.229328.113.short) paper.

You don't really want to use this package anymore and should consider it deprecated/defunct.

If you are analyzing 3'-seq data, you should be able to find the most up-to-date version of the software The Leslie Lab is using for that [this bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/leslielab/apa_2018/src).

## Overview

Extensions to Bioconductor GenomicFeatures package. Primarily, this implements a more "Gene Centric" view on the world, as opposed to base GenomicFeature's transcript/exon/cds centric view.
